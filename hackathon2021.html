                        Transparency in Governance system
                    </h1>
                    <p class="text-small">
                        Transparent governance means that government officials act openly, with citizens,  knowledge of the decisions the officials are making. Availability of information on government policies and actions, a clear sense of organizational responsibility, and an assurance that governments are efficiently administered and free of systemic corruption are important components of transparent governance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-small">Transparency is a fundamental element of abolishing corruption. Transparent governance is important to local governments and the communities they serve because corruption threatens good governance, leads to the misallocation of resources, harms public and private sector development, and distorts public policy. Controlling corruption is only possible when government, citizens, and the private sector cooperate to ensure transparency.</p>

                <p class="voter-data">
                    Before taking a decision on  a data capture method, an election management body (EMB) needs to  define what data needs to be captured. This data depends largely on the legislative requirements applicable to the voter register, but it can also include requirements specified by administrative and operational convenience.
                </p>
                <p class="voter-data">This means that data only needs to be captured if there is a legislative, administrative and/or operational reason for doing so. It may not be necessary to capture all of the data included by a voter on an applicaton form because some of these fields may be used by EMB staff to determine eligibility to register, but there may be no need to record the data in those fields the register database.</p>
